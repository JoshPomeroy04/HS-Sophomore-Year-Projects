# My Final Project
  
For my final project I will be making a Snake game using pygame. Snake is a
simple game in which you are a snake on a board trying to get food, and each
time you eat a peice of food you get longer. If you run into yourself or
the boarder you lose the game.


Resources I used to help understand pygame and other modules:
